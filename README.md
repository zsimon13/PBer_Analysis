# Overview of PyBer Analysis
The CEO of a ride share company, PyBer, has requested analysis of rideshare data including total number of rides, fare cost of the rides, total drivers, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. The data requested was seperated by types of cities to better show relationships in the data. This data would ultiamtely be used by decison-makers at PyBer to help better their business and business model.

# Results
Data for the following metrics were collected, and categorized by the 3 city types Urban, Suburban and Rural:
- Total Rides

A summary of the data collected can be seen in the table below.

We focused on the dates from January 1st, 2019 to April 29, 2019 to analyze Total Fares among City Types in the line chart shown above. This chart shows that the Urban cities consistently made between $1500 and $2500 every week. Suburban cities had the next highest weekly fares ranging between $600 and $1500. Rural cities produced the lowest weekly fares almost bottoming out to sub $100 and peaking at $500. Urban cities had peak fares in the month of March, while suburban cities peaked int late February and Rural cities peaked in April. The beginning of January seemed to be the lowest point of all city types. Though there are peaks and troughs in all three graphs, there are no obvious trends in any of the plots, and fares maintained pretty steady overall.

# Summary
After completeing the analysis of the rideshare data based on city type, the following recommendations have been created:
 - Ubran cities consistently produce the most revenue, rides and drivers. The demand could be due to highly populated areas relying on public transportaion and ride shares instead of personal vehicles. Continuing to invest in this sector should be the safest bet as demand is the highest here. 
 - Suburban cities performed in the middle in all categories. The demand for rideshares is there, however average price per ride and per driver may be to high as personal vehicles are much more prominent in suburban areas.
 - Rural cities have untapped potential. Total rides, fares and drivers are the lowest of the 3 city types by a long shot. However the average fare per ride is higher than the urban cities by aslmost 150% and average fare per driver is over 300% higher than urban cities. Marketing campaigns or incentives could help increase demand in this area. Lowering fare prices is another avenue that could create more interest as well.
